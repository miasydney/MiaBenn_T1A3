I have used  Rubocop which is a formatter extension that is based on this style guide. 

# Purpose

# R6 Features üè°
Develop a list of three features that will b included in the application, must include:
-describe at least THREE features
-describe each feature

Ensure they allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following concepts: 
-use of variables and the concept of variable scope
-loops and conditional control structures
-error handling



# R7
I used Trello in order to develop my implementation plan. 

Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 

(Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.)

# R8
Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
- how to use any command line arguments made for the application

In order to run this application on your machine, you will need to have Ruby installed. 
You can check this by running the command 'ruby -v'.
You will need to run ``bundle install`` to install all dependencies for this app.
Dependencies (gems).
ACCURATELY describe: steps to install the application; dependencies required by the application; system/hardware requirements; features of the application.
