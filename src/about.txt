------------ABOUT:------------
Mini City is a terminal command line application built using Ruby. The purpose of this app is to help students or working professionals to stay motivated and focused while sitting through study periods. It aims to increase productivity by creating a gamified study timer. Mini City allows for users to select a set study block, it will then bring up a countdown timer that will display in the terminal and count down how many seconds they have left until the study block is complete. On successful completion of a study period, the user will be awarded with 'coins' that will be added to their coins balance. This is an interactive balance that will update as the user uses the application as they are allowed to complete an unlimited amount of study periods and therefore amass an unlimited amount of coins! They can then use these coins to purchase houses and hotels that will display in the terminal as 'their city' and build a collection as they complete their study/work.
